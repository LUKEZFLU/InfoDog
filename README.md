# iLease (INFO 490/491 Capstone)
⚠️ This repo will shift private after June 30 2024

## Project Description

Subletting is a common solution for University of Washington students struggling to cover high rents during breaks. However, finding suitable tenants often proves difficult. This financial pressure led our team to develop a reliable platform that connects UW leaseholders with potential tenants. Using detailed search filters, users can find properties that fit their needs and communicate directly with leaseholders. Simple listing instructions enable leaseholders to easily add their properties and manage tenant requests. Our platform offers an essential solution to the subleasing challenges faced by UW students and also helps those seeking short-term accommodation in the UW area.

## Features (Scope)

- **Explore Listings**: Users can browse through a list of available rental properties, with options to view detailed pages for each listing.
- **Detailed Property View**: Each property has its own detailed page where users can see specifics such as images, amenities, price, and location.
- **Dynamic Filtering**: Users can filter properties based on criteria like location, price, room type, and more, with filters dynamically adjusting the viewable listings.
- **Contact Request**: Tenant able to request to get in contact with the leaseholder for more information if they're interested in that place. And leaseholder can reject or accept the request.
- **Profile**: User can update their personal information for better reach.
